    "# Review: Bias Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "A central notion underlying what we've been learning in lectures and sections so far is the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. If you remember back to Homework 3, we had a model that seemed to represent our data accurately. However, we saw that as we made it more and more accurate on the training set, it did not generalize well to unobserved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a different example, in face recognition algorithms, such as that on the iPhone X, a too-accurate model would be unable to identity someone who styled their hair differently that day. The reason is that our model may learn irrelevant features in the training data. On the contrary, an insufficiently trained model would not generalize well either. For example, it was recently reported that a face mask could sufficiently fool the iPhone X.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used solution in statistics to reduce overfitting consists of adding structure to the model, with something like regularization. This method favors simpler models during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance dilemma is closely related. The **bias** of a model quantifies how precise a model is across training sets. The **variance** quantifies how sensitive the model is to small changes in the training set. A **robust** model is not overly sensitive to small changes. The dilemma involves minimizing both bias and variance; we want a precise and robust model. Simpler models tend to be less accurate but more robust. Complex models tend to be more accurate but less robust.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an example of the bias variance tradeoff, the following picture was taken from a machine learning textbook. It represents throwing darts as a target and the ultimate goal is to hit a bullseye. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top left plot represents the ideal situation where we have low bias and low variance. In layman's terms, we are able to consistently hit the bullseye while having a low spread around the target. The spread indicates in a way how efficiently we are able to hit the bullseye. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top right plot indicates when the bias is low and the variance is high. Why is the bias low? Think about taking the average of all the points, it should be centered at the bullseye dot. However, the spread is higher than the top left plot. It indicates that while on average we are getting the bullseye, it comes at the cost of a large spread of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom left plot shows what happens when we are missing the bullseye (bias) but having a small spread, and the bottom right plot shows the worst scenario, missing the bullseye and having a large spread."

Which of the following 4 plots above do these plots look like in general? These plots indicate that our models are low variance and low bias producing and that the two models generalize well to new data. In summary, plotting these curves give us a rough idea of how appropriate our models are for the data. "

    "**Bagging** or bootstrap aggregation, is a technique for reducing the variance of an estimated prediction function. **Bagging** typically works especially well for high-variance, low-bias procedures, such as trees. For regression, we simply fit the same regression tree many times to bootstrap- sampled versions of the training data, and average the result. For classifi- cation, a committee of trees each cast a vote for the predicted class. Bagging results in correlated trees."

    "The essential idea in **Bagging** is to average many noisy but approximately unbiased models, and hence reduce the variance. Trees are ideal candidates for bagging, since they can capture complex interaction structures in the data, and if grown sufficiently deep, have relatively low bias. Since trees are notoriously noisy, they benefit greatly from the averaging. Moreover, since each tree generated in bagging is identically distributed (i.d.), the expectation of an average of B such trees is the same as the ex- pectation of any one of them. This means the bias of bagged trees is the same as that of the individual trees, and the only hope of improvement is through variance reduction. This is in contrast to **Boosting**, where the trees are grown in an adaptive way to remove bias, and hence are not i.d."

This approach is called bootstrap aggregation or **Bagging** for short.\n",
