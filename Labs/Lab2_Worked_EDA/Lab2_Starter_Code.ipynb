    "- Load and systematically address missing values, ancoded as `NaN` values in our data set, for example, by removing observations associated with these values.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Build** a DataFrame from the data (ideally, put all data in this object)\n",
    "2. **Clean** the DataFrame. It should have the following properties:\n",
    "    - Each row describes a single object\n",
    "    - Each column describes a property of that object\n",
    "    - Columns are numeric whenever appropriate\n",
    "    - Columns contain atomic properties that cannot be further decomposed\n",
    "3. Explore **global properties**. Use histograms, scatter plots, and aggregation functions to summarize the data.\n",
    "4. Explore **group properties**. Use groupby and small multiples to compare subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process transforms your data into a format which is easier to work with, gives you a basic overview of the data's properties, and likely generates several questions for you to followup in subsequent analysis."
